          In this game, use the following VERBS to interact with the world:
          "look at"
          "talk to"
          "pick up"
          "punch"
          "kick"
          "use"
          ~~~~~~~~~
          Use the VERBS first, followed by the OBJECT in question. The "use"
          command can be phrased as "use OBJECT" or as "use OBJECT with OBJECT"
          ~~~~~~~~~
          To move around in the world, use the following DIRECTION COMMANDS:
          "go north"
          "go south"
          "go east"
          "go west"
          ~~~~~~~~~
          The cardinal directions can also be entered without "go" in order to
          travel.
          ~~~~~~~~~
          To access this list of commands again, type "help" at any time.
